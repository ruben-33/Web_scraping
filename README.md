# Web_scraping
With python using BeautifulSoup 
# First we import the necessary libraries ( requests, BeautifulSoup and pickel)
with requests and BeautifulSoup we create a function to read through movies transcripts of html page of website called Scrapsfromtheloft
# We create a list consisting of the urls we want to read from
and another list to name the movies of those urls
# We use the pickle library to save our data in a file for later use and also to loading the file.
